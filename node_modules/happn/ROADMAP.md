THINGS WE WANT TO DO
=====================

1. command line interface
2. command for zipping a version of the db encrypted with the db public key (or a trusted key)
3. public and private key logins (as well as what we have: user names and passwords)

OPTIMISATIONS/ISSUES
====================
1. fix prototyping of service and initialization
2. on publish, have the 'write' function of the intra-proc socket interface do a clone
3. allow for only passing a function to the create method, options are then checked if function
